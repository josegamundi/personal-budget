Practical exercise from the **"Back-End Engineer Career Path"** course on [Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/), where a RESTful API is developed to manage a personal budget using virtual envelopes.

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal was to build an API that allows users to:

- Create, read, update, and delete budget envelopes (CRUD).
- Manage individual envelope balances.
- Transfer money between envelopes without exceeding limits.

Following REST best practices: proper naming conventions, HTTP status codes, data validation, and error handling.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **JavaScript**
- **Postman.app** (for testing)
- **Git** and Command Line

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
  
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/josegamundi/personal-budget.git

cd personal-budget
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the server:

```bash
node server.js
```

4. Use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test the available endpoints.
